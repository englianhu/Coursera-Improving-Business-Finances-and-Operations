### 1.1.3 Assignment Details

#### Part 1: Cost Variances

  Flatland, Inc. produces small machine parts for industrial use in a single plant. The plant manager recently received the following performance report for his plant for the most recent month.

```{r data-1, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
dat1 <- data_frame(Category = c('Units', 'Sales', 'Less variables costs:', 'Direct materials', 'Direct labor', 'Manufacturing overhead', 'Total variable costs', 'Contribution margin', 'Fixed manufacturing overhead', 'Operating profit'), Actual = c(5500, 132000, '', 22275, 20805, 15860, -58940, 73060, -26500, 46560), Budgeted = c(6000, 120000, '', 23400, 21000, 16500, -60900, 59100, -25000, 34100))

dat1 %>% formattable %>% as.htmlwidget
```

*table 1.1.3.1: financial statememt of Flatland Inc.*

  There were no beginning or ending inventories. The standard (budgeted) information available is as follows:

  - Direct materials: 1.5 kilograms per unit
  - Direct labor: 1/2 DL hour per unit
  - Labor wages: $7 per hour

The following actual data were collected:

  - Direct materials used: 8,250 kilograms
  - Direct labor hours worked: 2,850 hours

Additional information:

  - You should ignore income taxes.
  - Fixed costs include allocations of various costs, including managers' and VPs' salaries, and depreciation.

**Required:**

1. For both direct material and direct labor costs, calculate the spending, efficiency, and activity variances. Please provide supporting calculations, label your variances by name, and designate them as favorable or unfavorable. Note: If the given information is insufficient for answering any part of the above question, please denote that clearly, and identify the piece of information you are missing.

2. Provide a brief statement demonstrating your knowledge of the difference between a favorable and an unfavorable variance.

3. Provide at least two potential explanations for each of the variances (i.e., six) that you calculate. If you were to investigate these variances, who would you speak to in order to collect information relevant to your investigation?

#### Part 2: Revenue Variances

  The XTRA Appliance Manufacturing Corporation manufactures two models of vacuum cleaners, the Standard and the Super. The following information was gathered about the two products:

```{r data-2, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
dat2 <- data_frame(Category = c('Budgeted sales in units', 'Budgeted selling price (unit)', 'Budgeted CM per unit', 'Actual sales in units', 'Actual selling price (units)'), Standard = c(3200, 300, 210, 3500, 325), Super = c(800, 850, 550, 1500, 840))

dat2 %>% formattable %>% as.htmlwidget
```

*table 1.1.3.2: products' budget statememt of XTRA Appliance Manufacturing Corporation.*

**Required:**

1. Calculate the revenue variances (sales price, sales mix, and sales activity) for both the Standard and Super models. Please provide supporting calculations, label your variances by name, and designate them as favorable or unfavorable. Note: If the given information is insufficient for answering any part of the above question, please denote that clearly, and identify the piece of information you are missing.

2. Provide at least two potential explanations for each of the variances (i.e., six) that you calculate. If you were to investigate these variances, who would you speak to in order to collect information relevant to your investigation?

### 1.2 Review criterialess

  You will give a quantitative assessment of all parts of the submission. Then, you will provide qualitative feedback for the submission as a whole.

The following represents a guide for the quantitative assessment of **Part 1-3**:

  - **0 points: No answer, completely irrelevant answer, inadequate material, and/or evidence does not fit the argument**.
 - **5 points: Insufficient answer, incomplete, lacks supporting evidence**. An insufficientresponse is incomplete or incorrect. For calculations, the response fails to provide supporting calculations/steps.
  - **7 points: Passing, meets expectations**. A passing response addresses/answers the question, but some of the answer is not thoroughly explained. For calculations, the supporting calculations/steps are not clear.
  - **9 points: Well above average, exceeds expectations** An above average response addresses/answers the entire question and most of the answer is thoroughly explained. For calculations, most of the supporting calculations/steps are clear, but there are some minor deficiencies.
  - **10 points: Superior performance, excellent**. An excellent response answers the entire question, and thoroughly explains the answer. For calculations, all supporting calculations/steps are clearly presented.

Recommendations for Fair Peer Review:

  - The score should not be based on whether or not you agree with the answer, rather on whether the answer is complete and well-supported.
Both content and organization are important components of a response. Good writing is confident and clearly focused with relevant details to enrich the content. Good writing also follows instructions, such as word limits, and offers requested information.
  - A clear and concise answer is preferable to a long response that lacks coherence.
  - Focus should be on content; try not to unduly penalize responses for spelling or grammar.

### 1.3 Reminders

**Using the Forums**

  Your fellow students are a great resource, and we encourage you to sharpen your ideas against them in the forums. You can post your arguments in the forums and receive feedback before submitting your assignment.

**Honor Code**

  Please remember that you have agreed to the Honor Code, and your submission should be entirely yours. Our definition of plagiarism follows from standard literature: passing off someone else's work as your own, whether from your peers or Wikipedia. If you need to quote material, remember to cite your source, for example: "But, as expressed by Spinoza, all things excellent are as difficult as they are rare (Baruch Spinoza, "Ethica" source: thinkexist.com)."

# 2. Case Study

  - Section [2.1 Part 1: Cost Variances]

## 2.1 Part 1: Cost Variances

  Using the information provided in the Assignment Details section of the **Instructions** tab, respond to the following:

1. For both direct material and direct labor costs, calculate the spending, efficiency, and activity variances. Please provide supporting calculations, label your variances by name, and designate them as favorable or unfavorable. Note: If the given information is insufficient for answering any part of the above question, please denote that clearly, and identify the piece of information you are missing.

2. Provide a brief statement demonstrating your knowledge of the difference between a favorable and an unfavorable variance.

3. Provide at least two potential explanations for each of the variances (i.e., six) that you calculate. If you were to investigate these variances, who would you speak to in order to collect information relevant to your investigation?



## 2.2 Part 2: Revenue Variances

  Using the information provided in the Assignment Details section of the Instructions tab, respond to the following:

1. Calculate the revenue variances (sales price, sales mix, and sales activity) for both the Standard and Super models.

## 4.3 Speech and Blooper

  I do appreciate that [University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign](http://illinois.edu/) provides the [Improving Business Finances and Operations](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/business-operations) specialization via [Coursera](http://www.coursera.org). I used to study [Certified Accounting Technician (CAT)](http://www.accaglobal.com/ie/en/student/exam-support-resources/foundation-level-study-resources.html) course at [PAAC](http://www.paac.edu.my/index.php?p=location) more more decade. Now I need to review the finance and accounting course prior to conduct my research [Analyse the Finance and Stocks Price of Bookmakers](https://github.com/scibrokes/analyse-the-finance-and-stocks-price-of-bookmakers).
  There are few books that I need to read for further understanding.
