## 1.1 Instructions

### 1.1.1 Overview

  There are multiple steps to this mini-project. First, you will submit your answers to the questions in Parts 1, 2, and 3 based on the information in the Assignment Details section. Enter your answers directly in the spaces provided in the **My submission** tab. Please answer each question fully and concisely, including the steps of your calculations and/or citations as needed (you may use the [library guidelines to citations](http://www.library.illinois.edu/ugl/howdoi/citations.html) as a guide). Then, you will evaluate the submission of at least four of your peers based on the instructions provided.

### 1.1.2 How to Use Peer Review

1. **Submit your own assignment**. Click the My submission tab to begin working on your own assignment. You can save drafts of your work as you go, and you can come back later to continue working on your draft. When you are finished working, click the Preview button, verify your identity, and then Submit the assignment

2. **Give feedback to your peers**. You are required to give feedback to at least four peers to complete this assignment. You can begin giving feedback to other students as soon as you submit your assignment. Click the Review peers tab to get started. Feel free to provide additional reviews beyond the four required!

3. **Read feedback from your peers**.Your peers will also begin reviewing your project as soon as you submit it. You will receive an email notification of each new review. Only you will be able to see the feedback you receive. If you find someone’s review helpful, click the **This review is helpful** button to thank the reviewer.
Browse other projects. You can browse through all of the submitted assignments, even if you don't plan to review each one. Click the **like** button if you think someone did a great job on their assignment.

### 1.1.3 Assignment Details

  Choose an organizational setting and envision a strategic performance measurement system that would help facilitate and influence managers' and employees' actions and decisions related to pursuing organizational goals.

  The following are potential settings on which to focus. Again, **you only need to choose one setting**.

  - Business school within a large, public university
  - Recently opened food stand owned by an entrepreneur chef
  - Sports team ownership group (sport of your choosing)
  - Large-scale manufacturer
  - Not-for-profit organization addressing poverty issues in a local community

  *Note: If none of the above scenarios are interesting to you, please feel free to identify and use one of your choosing.*

**Your Deliverable**

  - **Part 1**: Clearly identify and describe your setting of interest.
  - **Part 2**: Briefly describe the overarching strategy of the organization, as well as the various perspectives (e.g., customer perspective, etc.) that the organization could adopt.
  - **Part 3**: Identify and describe no less than four organizational goals/objectives relevant to your setting. Be specific.
  - **Part 4**: Identify and describe at least two measures that correspond to each goal you identified in Part 3. Describe the measures in enough detail that would allow someone to implement and use the measure (i.e., how is the measure captured, what scale is used for the measure, etc.)
  - **Part 5**: Describe how you would provide incentives to managers and employees based on (at least) two of the measures you identified in Part 4.
  - **Part 6**: How might managers use subjective performance evaluation in this setting?

### 1.2 Review criteria

  You will give a quantitative assessment of all parts of the submission. Then, you will provide qualitative feedback for the submission as a whole.

The following represents a guide for the quantitative assessment of **Part 1-3**:

  - **0 points: No answer, completely irrelevant answer, inadequate material, and/or evidence does not fit the argument**.
 - **5 points: Insufficient answer, incomplete, lacks supporting evidence**. An insufficientresponse is incomplete or incorrect. For calculations, the response fails to provide supporting calculations/steps.
  - **7 points: Passing, meets expectations**. A passing response addresses/answers the question, but some of the answer is not thoroughly explained. For calculations, the supporting calculations/steps are not clear.
  - **9 points: Well above average, exceeds expectations** An above average response addresses/answers the entire question and most of the answer is thoroughly explained. For calculations, most of the supporting calculations/steps are clear, but there are some minor deficiencies.
  - **10 points: Superior performance, excellent**. An excellent response answers the entire question, and thoroughly explains the answer. For calculations, all supporting calculations/steps are clearly presented.

**Recommendations for Fair Peer Review:**

  - The score should not be based on whether or not you agree with the answer, rather on whether the answer is complete and well-supported.
Both content and organization are important components of a response. Good writing is confident and clearly focused with relevant details to enrich the content. Good writing also follows instructions, such as word limits, and offers requested information.
  - A clear and concise answer is preferable to a long response that lacks coherence.
  - Focus should be on content; try not to unduly penalize responses for spelling or grammar.

### 1.3 Reminders

**Using the Forums**

  Your fellow students are a great resource, and we encourage you to sharpen your ideas against them in the forums. You can post your arguments in the forums and receive feedback before submitting your assignment.

**Honor Code**

  Please remember that you have agreed to the Honor Code, and your submission should be entirely yours. Our definition of plagiarism follows from standard literature: passing off someone else's work as your own, whether from your peers or Wikipedia. If you need to quote material, remember to cite your source, for example: "But, as expressed by Spinoza, all things excellent are as difficult as they are rare (Baruch Spinoza, "Ethica" source: thinkexist.com)."

## 4.3 Speech and Blooper

  I do appreciate that [University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign](http://illinois.edu/) provides the [Improving Business Finances and Operations](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/business-operations) specialization via [Coursera](http://www.coursera.org). I used to study [Certified Accounting Technician (CAT)](http://www.accaglobal.com/ie/en/student/exam-support-resources/foundation-level-study-resources.html) course at [PAAC](http://www.paac.edu.my/index.php?p=location) more more decade. Now I need to review the finance and accounting course prior to conduct my research [Analyse the Finance and Stocks Price of Bookmakers](https://github.com/scibrokes/analyse-the-finance-and-stocks-price-of-bookmakers).
  There are few books that I need to read for further understanding.
