**Module 2 Assignment 1**

  Renovation Homeware has been manufacturing dining room furniture for several furniture outlets in the U.S. since 1969. The company is known for their dining room sets – tables, chairs, consoles, and sideboards – in which they offer tremendous choices and allow customization for dimensions, wood finish, upholstery, and fittings. The average promised lead time for their orders is eight weeks. Until recently, they were able to provide delivery within the promised due dates for 99.2% of orders, with an occasional slipup causing orders to be at most five days late. However, in the past two years, over 33% orders have been over three weeks late, leading to several complaints from buyers.

  Renovation prides itself on the quality of the furniture they produce and their willingness to incorporate requests for changes until the last possible time until the order is released to production. Their manufacturing operation is set up by departments. Wood cutting, upholstery storage and cutting, assembly, hardware fitting, polishing, finishing, inspection, and packaging are organized as separate mini-shops, and furniture makes its way through these departments as needed. A sophisticated scheduling system helps them keep track of due dates and job schedules.

  There has been a shift in the mix of orders for Renovation, and this shift appears to mirror a change in the customer mix. Compared to two years ago, order sizes of 1 to 5 sets of one type have been reduced to half of what they used to be, while order sizes of 45–50 sets of one type with hardly any customization have nearly doubled. The customer mix now includes more retail chains, besides the traditional boutique stores and interior designers. As a sign of this increasing trend, one of Renovation Homeware’s major customers, Eat-In Dining Rooms, recently contacted them with a potential order of 125 single type of dining room sets for their newly expanded stores and warehouses in the Midwestern U.S. This order is for one of the cheaper sets that Renovation makes and requires no other customization other than two wood finish types in the mix. Until now, Eat-In’s order quantities for any one set had been quite small, with the largest order size being 5, even when the total order was for a larger quantity of up to 100. For the current large-volume order, Eat-In is demanding a shorter lead time of six weeks and is pushing for a discounted price, citing the large quantity of the same set as a reason. Such demands for price discounts have also been brought up recently by buyers for several other furniture outlets, although it has never been an issue in the past.

  The production manager for Renovation, Cynthia Natarajan, is in a fix. On the one hand, there is the potential for increasing sales by accepting large orders of identical sets, albeit at discounted prices. On the other hand, she has longstanding customers of customized sets complaining about slipping on delivery dates and workmanship. She is also not sure how she can provide the high volume orders at shorter lead times. The marketing manager, Vera DeLillo, believes that customers deserve the quantity discounts for larger orders and does not see why Cynthia is not able to extract efficiencies from large volumes of the same sets as well as provide products more quickly than before.

  Cynthia believes that there are some long-term operations strategy decisions that need to be made and that may need investments in the production process. She has scheduled a meeting with the marketing manager, Vera DeLillo, and the managing director, Gene Phang, to explain, from an operations management perspective:

(1)	The causes of the current delivery date problems and the challenges in accepting the new large-volume orders with the current process design

(2)	A proposed process design for accepting the new large-volume orders while continuing to serve the remaining customized orders customers.

(3)	Other solutions for consideration that would require a shift in overall business strategy

  Based on general guidelines about matching process arrangements to product requirements, please help Cynthia Natarajan put together information on all three topics.

# 2. Operational Concepts

## Part 1

  Discuss the causes of the current delivery date problems and the challenges in accepting the new large-volume orders with the current process design.

  Let's summarise the problem, the previous orders might a lot of scattered customers who order 1-5 sets but now the orders by wholesalers/retailer chain for 45-50 sets have blooming.
  
  We can know the company is small but not a huge business group since previously majority orders are 1-5 sets but recent 2 years became mostly on 45-50 sets and maximum 100 sets. The customization request from customers became more complicated due to high volume and diversified designs.
  
- **Insufficient resource**: Insufficient staffs to produce high volume orders. It might includes the stockkeepers, delivery mans, and production staffs. The existing machine, delivery transportation and also the supplied material might also insufficient. There has another issue which might probably existing huge cargo for logistics have not enough as well. The high volume orders might probably includes diversified design of products. A high volume of diversified products might probably need higher technological machine to produce it compare to existing machine.
- **Skilled staffs**: Due to the high volume orders have blooming recent two years, the existing skilled staffs unable handle sudden high volume orders smoothly. Meanwhile, there might probably new employed staffs not yet master the skills.
- **The smoothness of operation flow**: Insufficiency of resource on manpower, materials, machine, logistics might cause the conflicts of priority and also sufficiency of stocks for delivery. For example, some return stocks might disturb the planned logistical line. There will be another issue to the logistics staffs work in new opened store in Midwestern US where they are not familiar with the location of the distributors/agencies to avoid the heavily traffic routes.
- **Productivity**: The high volume orders might exhaust a lot of human resource as well as machine. For example, the machines keep up running 24 hours everyday might need mainatenance. Insufficient staff might forced existing staffs to work overtime in order to completed the stocks. However longtime working without rest/idle time might decrease the productivity of staffs. Same with inssuficient machine while some need to be maintain for continue using.
- **Customization of orders**: When the volume of orders increasing, the number of customization request on the design for the products will also increase. The customization request from customers might always interrupt the process of produce. Let say a customer request to change the design upon get the view of the products, if who keep request to modify the design during the process of produce the product a high cost might made to the company. Besides, the completion and also delivery time spending will be increase.

## Part 2

  Propose a process design for accepting the new large-volume orders while continuing to serve the remaining customized orders customers.

- **Limitation**: Set a limit of customization request, for example a customer might only entitle free charges customization for two times. There will be a certain charges after that.
- **Time restriction**: Set a closing time for customization request in advance to start stocks-in and produce the products. A high volume order might need a lot of raw material to produce while a time setting will reduce the probability of stock return to supplier. It will affect the business cooperation between the company and also material suppliers if the frequency of stock return request is high. Other than that, a certain charges might also cost to the company since the material suppliers have other distributors and buyers.
- **Minimum Requirement**: Set a minimum requirement to customers/wholesalers which is only order a certain amount can be entitled the benefit.

```{r custom, echo = FALSE}
cus <- data.frame(`Order Amount` = c(levels(cut(1:100, breaks = seq(0, 100, 5))), '>100'), `Number of Allowed Customization` = c(rep(0, 5), rep(1, 5), rep(2, 4), rep(3, 3), rep(4, 3), 'unlimit'), `Allowed Customization Days In Advance` = c(rep(0, 8), rep(1, 7), rep(2, 6)), `Estimated Delivery Time in Week` = c(rep(1, 4), rep(2, 4), rep(3, 4), rep(4, 3), rep(5, 3), rep(6, 2), rep(7, 1))) %>% tbl_df

cus$Order.Amount <- as.character(cus$Order.Amount)
cus$Order.Amount[1] <- '(1,5]'
cus$Order.Amount <- factor(cus$Order.Amount)

cus %>% kable(caption = 'Customization Service to Customers')
```

*Table 2.1: Sample table of customization service*

  Above is a sample table to differentiate the customization service provides to customers based on different **Order Amount**, The allowed days for customization count from the date of signed order. The estimated delivery time (in week unit) is count from the date of signed order. Due to I never work in furniture industry and unable to estimate the delivery time, here I simply set a time duration for sample only.

## Part 3

  Discuss other solutions for consideration that would require a shift in overall business strategy.

- **Downpayment**: A certain amount or percentage of the price for the orders need to be paid in order to reduce the loss of stock return. High volume orders do not means all will be receivable sales. If the marketing department keep hard selling with promotion with discounted price or booking without down-payment might probably make loss to company. For example, a high volume of stock return might loss all the costs (overhead cost, fixed rental and utilities cost, material cost, salary wages flexible cost etc.) to produce the product and eventually return back. The store will occupied with a lot of returned stock. The durability of wooden furniture might not very long since it might be spoiled due to erosion by termites in store. A certain period of fund chasing need to be scheduled to manage the success of receive the receivable debt from sales.
- **Number of diversified products**: A certain maximum set of orders might probably given by production manager based on their department's capability. Some furniture might cost a lot of time to produce compare to others. A list of the products and time spending schedule or time table will easier for whole operation flow since production manager might estimate how much of furniture might completed within a certain period and predictable and easier for marketing department to elaborate to customers about the estimated delivery time.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Besides, there will be a long term benefit if accounting department can apply statistical analysis on the cost per raw material and per item of very single product (includes analyse the mean, standard errors, and count in the average spoiled items might probably occurred within a certain number of products) will easily to know the operating cost and also price setting, discount rate for wholesalers etc and the profit will be more easier to control. A certain discount might apply to reduce the bad debts and increase the receivable debts.
- **Logistics**: The high volume orders might come from everywhere around US. The new opened store in Midwestern US will definitely increase the delivery time. However a schedule and the clients within territory need to be assign to easier for stocks delivery and also customer servicing. Since the company has a sophisticated scheduling system (Assume the system is similar with Walmart, which is the distributors and suppliers can directly know their stocks level, location of stocks, price of stocks, connecting store is which nearest store etc. It will make both distributors and also suppliers manage their stocks by themselves with certain authority) the distributors within the area might easily know the stocks and when need to be refilled.
- **Customers Classification**: Categorize customers level in order to eaisier for operation. We can categorize ordinary, bronze class, silver class, gold class and platinium class customers to enjoy different benefit. The services provided are defference accordingly. The database can be included the number of complaint and also the type of complaint in order to categorise the priority to solve. The more number of complaint on a particular issue will be higher priority to solve. The *Table 2.1* is a simple table to categorise the customers.
- **Differentiate Department**: Base on the **Customers Classification**, the furniture company might seperate 6 operational teams/departments to produce the ordinary, bronze class, silver class, gold class, platinium class and also a special team while the number of staffs will be different as well. Standardize the production line will increase the productivity since different team will easily learn how to handle the certain amount of orders and customers' class. Meanwhile the skilled staffs might take turn to exchange between classes/teams to learn how to different customers' class. The world first CEO --- Jack Welch used to emphasize the trainning, research and development deopartment is the core department in General Electric. The exchange between teams/departments might consider as a trainning during working for small company while there will be best if the company can setup a training department to assess the quality of staffs every week to maintain at a certain level of quality of company for long term growth.
- **Short Term Planned Design**: pre-lesease the catalogue of planned design of furnitures within next 3 years to distributors and also wholesalers. Firstly, it will make wholesalers view the coming design prior to booking, and it will be easier for designer to design and also customize the design of furnitures prior to launch and sell to distributors/wholesalers.

# 3. Conclusion

  I tried to write my answer above based on my understanding on the assignment prior to watch below video. I do say sorry since my Enlish language is not good. Below is the answer from my peers.
  
```
Part 1

Discuss the causes of the current delivery date problems and the challenges in accepting the new large-volume orders with the current process design.
The causes of the current delivery date problems are below highlighted:-

          - Company’s existing capabilities and product requirements by customers is in misalignment and late delivery being the consequence.

          - Existing process design cannot effectively address customer varying needs.

          - Orders traffic has increased considerably in recent times especially for standardized products and therefore affecting the lead time.



The challenges in accepting the new large-volume orders with the current process design are:-

          - Inevitable late delivery.

          - Total system constraint as the job shop environment is not designed for large repetitive production system.

         -Job shop is characterized by high-mix, low-volume production, therefore difficulty in maintaining large quantity of raw material                inventories may be experienced.

          -Overtime may be invoked so as to meet delivery schedules.

          -Paradigm shift to batch arrangement from make-to-order demand driven business model might not be feasible overnight.

Part 1 is worth 5 points total. Points are only given for correct/reasonable answers in the manner specified below; incorrect/unreasonable answers get zero points.

- 0 pts No answer, or irrelevant answer

- 4 pts Two specific process design aspects or operations strategy concepts correctly covered in the answer, with specific connections to the context of the case.
- 5 pts Appropriate tie back to the larger problems of the company.



Part 2

Propose a process design for accepting the new large-volume orders while continuing to serve the remaining customized orders customers.
Propose a process design is as follows:

          - On the same facility run job shop for high-mix, customized, and low production items and on the other hand, batch for standardized high volume items, while  minimizing change over time.

          - Without investing more on assets and labor force, adopt ‘make to stock’ for the large volume orders and then ‘make to order’ for the customized product  as appropriate.

Part 2 is worth 5 points total. Points are only given for correct/reasonable answers in the manner specified below; incorrect/unreasonable answers get zero points.

- 0 pts No answer, or irrelevant answer
- 1 pt Superficial mention of one process design aspect or operations strategy concept applicable to the question
- 2 pts One specific process design aspect or operations strategy concept correctly covered in the answer, with specific connection to the context of the case

- 4 pts Two specific process design aspects or operations strategy concepts correctly covered in the answer, with specific connections to the context of the case
- 5 pts Appropriate tie back to the larger problems of the company



Part 3

Discuss other solutions for consideration that would require a shift in overall business strategy.
Settle for Standard items production while giving up on customized items:

          -Since the company has potential to fulfill large order at low price, the production line can be reconfigured to serve such purpose all things being equal.

          -Low skilled workforce can be injected into the system  to optimize output at low cost.

          -Efficiently utilize  all available resources with quality in focus for enhanced customer experience.

          -Large inventory of raw material will result in lower production cost.


Settle for customized items while trading off Standard items:

          -Optimize existing capabilities to serve your customers better.

          -Improve on job shop arrangement to engender a shorter lead time.

          -Reduces non value adding activities to enable accurate promise delivery date to customers.

          -Ensure material is always available as it is a critical factor on the job loading time and production lead time.

Part 1

  Discuss the causes of the current delivery date problems and the challenges in accepting the new large-volume orders with the current process design.
  
  The causes of the current delivery date problems are due to change in customer's expectations and problem in old production process which do not have provision to equip the changes in expectation. Previously the customers where expecting 1 to 5 customized sets and were willing to wait for certain amount of time. Now the no.of customized sets they are expecting is increased and they wanted the product to be delivered earlier. Also Previously the bulk orders like 20 to 50 sets were received half ordered. However, now due to the increased retail chains the bulk orders placed are doubled and they are expecting discount as they are ordering same product in bulk or high volume with earlier delivery requests.
  
  The challenges in accepting the new large-volume orders with the current process design is there is no enough automation, or not much provision to release products in batch rather than in-line and no machinery has ability to address the change in volume order production and also the employees who creates the products skill were not put in a platform to well utilize their skills in a versatile fashion.

Part 2

  Propose a process design for accepting the new large-volume orders while continuing to serve the remaining customized orders customers.
  
  Even without giving too much specific information about how they would be arranged they can think of their manufacturing shop to be arranged in a job shop kind of environment, with different departments doing different things, as needed, for different types of designs, for different types of dining room sets. So what goes with the job shop is the idea of flexibility in volumes, and accepting changes. And then, they can also think of other features about a job shop, like skilled labor, like the idea of not thinking too much about change over times, and also the idea of being able to expand capacity in small chunks. So that would be something that they would be able to do in a job shop.

  Also the fact that now they would have to do a lot of changeovers between high volume and low volume orders would mean that the low volume orders would get stuck behind large volume orders and then the large volume orders would have to be broken up because otherwise they are keeping the low volume orders behind for a longer period of time. So there would be an increase in that sense in the number of changeovers that they would be doing. Even for the same product for a high volume order, they would have to do more changeovers. It would be definitely challenging in terms of scheduling for the same reasons

  In terms of the value of skilled labor, as they are getting orders of  increasing volume and they're trying to make more standardized stuff they have skilled labor who's talents are being wasted when they're making the same product over and over again. Very standardized product that doesn't need too much customization. So, in that sense their costs are going to remain high while the customers are asking for lower prices. And the idea of expanding capacity is very different when they think about a job shop environment, versus when they want to do it for high volume. Thinking about expanding capacity for a job shop meaning that they would have to add specialized equipment in each department if they wanted to increase the total volume. And even if they were to do that in small increments, it would turn out to be very expensive because they're not thinking of things like automation, things like taking stuff through in quick flow time. they're not going to be able to get cost effective in terms of expanding their capacity. As, the new customers are wanting high volume, lower prices and as they want discounts in their prices, and they want quick lead times.Maybe they don't have enough volume for going for a line kind of arrangement, but definitely more like a batch. More something like where they are having at least some steps that are put into a line, or a line that they are changing over between different types of products so that they can take advantage of the high volumes, and get them to flow through the process much quicker then they would in a job shop, where they would have jumbled flows. The process arrangement would be more like a batch. It would be more with longer runs. They could focus on the idea of fewer set ups and try to optimize, take that set up and that they might have and use it over a larger production run that they would do so that they are spreading that fixed cost over a larger number of units. They should be focusing on that, or Renovation should be focusing on that. They should seek opportunities for automation taking the artistic perspective out of the picture in some sense at least to some extent because customers are not demanding it. So the skilled labor coming out and the automation going in, at least for some parts of the process. They will need to be focusing more on conformance to specifications. When customers want a high volume product, they're expecting standardized product. They want product to look alike. They're going to accept orders based on something that's in the show room and then what gets delivered should be more or less similar to what they saw in the showroom. So the focus has to shift from it being creativity and making different types of units to making conforming to specifications that the customer has. And finally, they would have to give up this idea of flexibility in terms of letting customers make changes until the last minute. They would have to freeze the production schedule, otherwise, again going back to the idea of changeovers, they would be hit with a lot of changeovers. So they would have to have this idea of focusing on freezing the production schedule. And saying, look, you have to tell us in advance how many products of what kind you need. And then what would happen is that some of the customers who were earlier able to make the changes might not be happy. But this is something that they need to think about if they're going to think about serving those customers that want high volume and lower prices. 

  For good process design, One is the idea of a plant within a plant. We can have the idea of a certain part of the machine, the shop having a job shop kind of arrangement, whereas a certain part of the manufacturing shop having a batch kind of arrangement.  That gives some advantages in terms of sharing of knowledge. Need to use the job shop for customized and need to use the batch for high volume. So that would be one design, a plant within a plant kind of an arrangement. 

  Both of them are made pretty much under the same roof, but they have very distinct processes separated from each other, although, there is some sharing of knowledge and some sharing of competencies between those two processes as well. So, that would be one arrangement that they could use that they could consider if they wanted to go after both of these customer segments, go after the order winners and qualifiers of both these customer segments. 

  The second arrangement that they could have thought of is maybe think of splitting the process, So the idea of having a made to stock arrangement up to a certain extent, and then maybe continuing with a high volume for the for the standardized products and then having a job shop for the customization for the products that are going to be customized. Now this would need some type of adjustment to the expectations that the customers have, what kind of customization you would be able to offer. It should not go all the way back into the process. So they can push product all the way to a certain extent based on made to stock, or having a standardized product more like a standardized product to a certain extent. Then, from then on, getting it customized based on whatever the customer wants. So these are two possible combinations that they could have thought of and both should, in theory, be able to work if Renovation would decide to go after both types of customers. 

  So earlier when they're talking about customized product making it specifically for certain customers and having a flexible process, their purchases may not have been very high volume. They may not have thought about it too much. MRP system or an ERP system that helps them schedule better. Enterprise Resource planning system or manufacturing resource planning system that helps them plan better based on what is the demand of that parent product and breaking it down to the different sub assemblies that are needed and sending the orders out to different departments that need to make those sub assemblies so that the final product can be assembled. That's something that they would have to think about, based on this high volume market that seems to be coming up at a faster rate. Forecasting off of production volumes, what kind of volumes are they expecting would be needed in order to make investments into large volume kind of automated batch systems or line systems. They would have to at least limit the number of designs that they would offer. Based on different process arrangements based on we said either, we need to adjust the expectations of customers at least to some extent. So Renovation might have to do that to some extent. They may have to go back to the design process for designing their furniture and think about more modular designs and part commonalty. They can have certain types of assemblies, sub assemblies, in stock, that they can combine in different ways based on the orders that they get, and that they can store, that they can keep in stock whenever they have slack times from their large volume lines. 

  They can focus on reducing the changeover time. That would be useful in terms of being able to have a line that is high volume, at the same time not that inflexible in terms of changeover. And then they would also have to think about their employees in terms of the skill of the employees and what kind of skill set they would expect their employees to have. So those would be some process related decisions that they would need to make. And here they can see that these might have impact on their hiring, these might have impact on their design and R and D as well.

Part 3

Discuss other solutions for consideration that would require a shift in overall business strategy.
As they want to be in the market on their own terms. They could have 2 choices that they could have come up with. One is either they could focus on the customized and said this is what we're good at. and they could say that they don't really want to get into that standard product market and they will go after different customers who care about this customization. and they can move away from their current customers who are getting into high volume and go find a different a niche, a market that cares about what they are good at. So that would preserve their core competencies. They could continue to offer what they're offering, and then they would have to work with business strategy as well as their marketing strategy folks to see if that's something that everybody agrees with and that they can go after in an aligned fashion. So that would be important if they were to decide on this kind of a focus going forward. Another focus that they could have, an alternative focus, the opposite extreme of the customized would be completely give up on the customize and focus only on the standardize. So no breaking up the process as from being a job shop to a plant within a plant or combining two different types of processes but completely going after the high volume market which would require a drastic change in terms of not only the production process but also as it says here, their purchasing, their scheduling, their technology, and the people. So this would be in some sense a bigger risk getting into a market that they may not be very familiar with. But this is certainly something that they would consider as being a choice that that they have to make.

## 4.3 Speech and Blooper

  Same as pevious assignment --- [Operations Management : Module 1 Assignment 1](http://rpubs.com/englianhu/operational-management-module1-assignment1), I do appreciate that [University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign](http://illinois.edu/) provides the management course via [Coursera](http://www.coursera.org). I used to work in FujiXerox as customer service operator for one month and learnt the logistics for printer service maintanance around Taiwan province. Besides, I learnt some knowledge about sales-stocks flowchart when I work as a salesman in Maybooks few month ago. I am a newbie in marketing, cost measurement and inventory management as well as whole operating chain. Keep up learning and hope to learn some management skills and knowledges from **Operations Management**.
