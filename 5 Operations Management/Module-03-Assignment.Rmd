# 2. Operational Concepts

## Part 1

  Based on Bintu’s ordering policy, what is her total annual cost associated with inventory?

```{r annum-inv1, echo = FALSE}
dat %>% colSums %>% t %>% data.frame %>% mutate(Week = 52, Sess = 'All') %>% kable(caption = 'Annual Total Summary')
```

*Table 2.1.1 : Annual Summary*

  Below is a table which breakdown the seasonal orders which are 13 weeks once.

```{r annum-inv2, echo = FALSE}
ddply(dat, .(Sess), summarise, Sales.YBL = sum(`Year Before Last`), Sales.LY = sum(`Last Year`), Insurance = sum(Insurance)) %>% tbl_df %>% mutate(Stock.In = 2600, Stock.Bal.YBL = cumsum(Stock.In - Sales.YBL), Stock.Bal.LY = cumsum((Stock.In + c(Stock.Bal.YBL[4], 0, 0, 0)) - Sales.LY)) %>% 
  formattable(list(
    Sales.YBL = formatter('span', 
                          style = x ~ style(color = ifelse(rank(-x) <= 1, 'darkgoldenrod', 'silver')), 
                          x ~ sprintf('%d (rank: %02d)', x, rank(-x))), 
    Sales.LY = formatter('span', 
                         style = x ~ style(color = ifelse(rank(-x) <= 1, 'darkgoldenrod', 'silver')), 
                         x ~ sprintf('%d (rank: %02d)', x, rank(-x))),
    Stock.Bal.YBL = formatter('span', 
                              style = x ~ style(color = ifelse(x >= 0, 'green', 'red')), 
                              x ~ icontext(ifelse(x >= 0, 'ok', 'remove'), ifelse(x >= 0, x, x))), 
    Stock.Bal.LY = formatter('span', 
                              style = x ~ style(color = ifelse(x >= 0, 'green', 'red')), 
                              x ~ icontext(ifelse(x >= 0, 'ok', 'remove'), ifelse(x >= 0, x, x)))
    )) %>% as.htmlwidget
```

*Table 2.1.2 : Sessonal Summary*

$$total\ annual\ cost = orderding\ cost + inventory\ holding\ cost + insurance\ cost$$

![*Equation 2.1.1 : Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)*](figure/inventory.jpg)

  - Q = 2600 Units per season/order/lot.
  - H = The everage cost of a smartphone is $50, additional 11% and weekly $0.01 insure cost. Therefore the **holding cost per unit** is `r paste0('$', 50 * 0.11 + 0.01 * 52)`.
  - D = 10400 units where 52 Weeks ÷ 13 Weeks = 4 seasons/orders/lots per year.
  - S = \$200 cost per season/lot/order, then **annual ordering cost** will be `r paste0('$', 200 * 4)`.
  - Weekly insurance is 0.01, then **annual insurance** will be `r paste0('$', 0.01 * 52)`.

$$C = \frac{2,600 units}{2}(\$50 \times 11\% + \$0.01 \times 52 weeks) + \frac{10,400 units}{2,600 units}(\$200)$$

  Therefore annual cost (exclude other cost which has not given in the question) will be **`r paste0('$', (50 * 0.11 + 0.01 * 52) * 2600 / 2 + 10400 / 2600 * 200)`**. You can using calculator for inventory cost via [Total Inventory Cost](http://www.ultimatecalculators.com/total_inventory_cost_calculator.html).

## Part 2

  Compute the EOQ.
  
**What is an 'Economic Order Quantity - EOQ'?**

  An economic order quantity (EOQ) is an inventory-related equation that determines the optimum order quantity that a company should hold in its inventory given a set cost of production, demand rate and other variables. This is done to minimize variable inventory costs. The full equation is as follows:

**Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)**

$$EOQ = \sqrt{\frac{2SD}{PI}}$$

  where :

  - S = Setup costs
  - D = Demand rate
  - P = Production cost
  - I = Interest rate (considered an opportunity cost, so the risk-free rate can be used)

*Equation 2.2.1 : Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)*

  Read more: [Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) Definition | Investopedia](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economicorderquantity.asp#ixzz4B5eToKHY)
  
  You can also read [ECONOMIC ORDER QUANTITY (EOQ) MODEL: Inventory Management Models : A Tutorial](https://scm.ncsu.edu/scm-articles/article/economic-order-quantity-eoq-model-inventory-management-models-a-tutorial) with example to know that cost of product is not in count.

![*Equation 2.2.2 : Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)*](figure/eoq.gif)

  - A = Demand for the year
  - Cp = Cost to place a single order
  - Ch = Cost to hold one unit inventory for a year

  Now we try to given the value for every single parameter/variable.

  - Cost of holding a unit is `r paste0('$', 50 * 0.11 + 0.01 * 52)`.
  - S = $200
  - D = 10400 annual sales
  - P = 50 x 11% = $5.5
  - I = $0.01 x 52 weeks = $0.52

  The optimal order quantity is **EOQ = `r sqrt((2 * 200 * 10400)/(5.5 + 0.52))`** units.

## Part 3

  What is her total annual cost associated with inventory using EOQ?

**Total Relevant Cost (TRC)**

$$Total\ Relevant\ Cost\ (TRC) = Yearly\ Holding\ Cost + Yearly\ Ordering\ Cost$$

![*Equation 2.3.1 : Total Relevant Cost*](figure/trc.gif)

![*Graph 2.3.1 : What would holding and ordering costs look like for the years?*](figure/costs.gif)

  - A = Demand for the year
  - Cp = Cost to place a single order
  - Ch = Cost to hold one unit inventory for a year
  - Q = Quantity/size per order

** *Relevant* because they are affected by the order quantity Q

  - **Yearly holding cost** = `r paste0('$', 50 * 0.11 + 0.01 * 52)` x `r floor(sqrt((2 * 200 * 10400)/(5.5 + 0.52)))` units ÷ 2 = `r paste0('$', (50 * 0.11 + 0.01 * 52) * floor(sqrt((2 * 200 * 10400)/(5.5 + 0.52))) / 2)`.
  - **Yearly ordering cost** = 10400 units ÷ `r floor(sqrt((2 * 200 * 10400)/(5.5 + 0.52)))` units x $200 = `r paste0('$', round(10400 / sqrt((2 * 200 * 10400)/(5.5 + 0.01 * 52)) * 200, 2))`.
  
  **Total Relevant Cost (TRC) = `r paste0('$', ((50 * 0.11 + 0.01 * 52) * floor(sqrt((2 * 200 * 10400)/(5.5 + 0.52))) / 2) + (round(10400 / sqrt((2 * 200 * 10400)/(5.5 + 0.01 * 52)) * 200, 2)))`**

## Part 4

  If there is a lead time of two weeks for smartphones, and given that the standard deviation of demand is 29, what would be the reorder point for a cycle service level of 90% (safety stock service factor = 1.28) using the continuous review inventory management system?

![*Graph 2.4.1 : Sample of reorder point*](figure/reorder.jpg)

![*Graph 2.4.2 : Sample of reorder point calculation*](figure/reorder-sample.jpg)

![*Equation 2.4.1 : reorder point*](figure/reorder.gif)

 - Average weekly demand = 2600 units ÷ 13 weeks = `r 2600 / 13` units.
 - Lead time = 2 weeks
 - Standard deviation of demand = 29
 - Standard deviation to service level probability = 1.28
 
 **R = `r (2600 / 13 * 2) + (29 * 1.28 * sqrt(2))`** units.

## Part 5

  State the decision rules for Bintu if she now follows a continuous review inventory policy based on your computations.

  Bintu should reorder (EOQ) **`r floor(sqrt((2 * 200 * 10400)/(5.5 + 0.52)))`** units when the stocks balance reach (ROP) **`r floor((2600 / 13 * 2) + (29 * 1.28 * sqrt(2)))`** units.

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
## Set options back to original options
options(op)
```

# 3. Conclusion

  Base from the dataset which we initially don't know the stocks balance, however we measure the optimal reorder point as well as the reorder size for Bintu.

## 4.3 Speech and Blooper

  Same as pevious assignment --- [Operations Management : Module 1 Assignment 1](http://rpubs.com/englianhu/operational-management-module1-assignment1), I do appreciate that [University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign](http://illinois.edu/) provides the management course via [Coursera](http://www.coursera.org).
  
  I initially don't know how to calculate the reorder point and reorder size from the video solution. However I had searched and read the relevant articles to know the concepts and the formulas. I am a newbie in marketing, cost measurement and inventory management as well as whole operating chain. Keep up learning and hope to learn some management skills and knowledges from **Operations Management**.
  
  - `mPlot(x = 'Week', y = c('Year Before Last', 'Last Year'), type = 'Line', data = dat)` facing connection error to read the data with RMarkdown but working fine if run via chunk.
  - `googleVis::gvisLineChart()` only shows **Edit me!** but no graph.
