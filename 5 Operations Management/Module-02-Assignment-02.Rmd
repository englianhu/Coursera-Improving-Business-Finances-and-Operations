![Watches Assembly](figure/watches.jpg)

*Figure 1.1 : Assembly watches*

  From above picture, we try to categorize 5 workstations to assembly a complated watch. For example:

  - **1st Workstation** : Assembly the accessory part for clock.
  - **2nd Workstation** : Assembly the electronic board.
  - **3rd Workstation** : Assembly the electrical conductor. 
  - **4th Workstation** : Assembly the device cover.
  - **5th Workstation** : Assembly the belt of the watch.

# 2. Operational Concepts

## Part 1

  A line for final assembly of watches has 5 workstations with equal amount of work for the single worker at each station. The workers sit next to each other passing each watch to the worker at the next station as they are done. The workers are paid $15 per hour for the normal 7 hours of work per day. The line normally completes 300 watches per day.

  When everything works as planned (no errors and breakdowns) completing the expected daily quantity, what is the implied cycle time at each workstation?

$$Ws = 5, Hrs = 7, Py = $15, Wc = 300$$
$$Paid / unit = (Ws \times Hrs \times Py) / Wc$$
$$Productivity / dollar = Wc / (Ws \times Hrs \times Py)$$
$$Productivity / hour = Wc / (Ws \times Hrs)$$
$$Paid / cycle = Hrs \times Py$$
$$Productivity / cycle = Wc / (Ws \times Hrs)$$

```{r part-01, echo = FALSE}
## Paid per unit
Pu = (5 * 7 * 15) / 300

## Productivity per dollar
Pd = 300 / (5 * 7 * 15)

## Productivity per hour per workstation
Pc = 300 / (5 * 7)

## Paid per hour per cycle
Pyc = 5 * 15

## Paid per day per workstation
Pyw = 7 * 15

## Paid per day
Pyp = 7 * 15 * 5

## Productivity per hour per cycle
Ph = 300 / 7

## Cycle time per unit.
Cy = 7 / 300

## Productivity per workstation per day
Pw = 300 / 5

data_frame(Category = c('Paid per Unit', 'Productivity per dollar', 'Productivity per hour per workstation', 'Paid per hour per cycle', 'Paid per day per workstation', 'Paid per day', 'Productivity per hour per cycle', 'Cycle time per unit', 'Productivity per workstation per day'), Figure = c(Pu, Pd, Pc, Pyc, Pyw, Pyp, Ph, Cy, Pw)) %>% kable(Caption = 'Summary of Productivity Cycle')
```

*Table 2.1 Summarise table for productivity cycle.*

- From above table, we can know that the **wager per unit** watch produced will be `r paste0('$', round(Pu, 2))` without any idle time.
- The **productivity rate for every dollar paid** is `r Pd`, which is every single dollar paid to each workstation will produce `r paste0(round(Pd * 100, 2), '%')` of a complated unit watch.
- Assume that the average of the productivity across 5 workstations are equally, the **productivity per hour per workstation** means `r Pc` unit of watch for a workstation will be partly assembly.
- **Paid per hour per cycle** is the wager paid for 5 workstation per hour which is `r paste0('$', Pyc)`. To know the **wager paid for 5 workers per day** will be `r paste0('$', Pyp)`. Meanwhile, **Paid for a worker per day** is `r paste0('$', Pyw)`.
- **Productivity per hour per cycle** is the `r floor(Ph)` units of completed unit watches and `r paste0(round(Ph - floor(Ph), 2) * 100, '%')` of a partially assemblied unit of watch will be made per hour.
- **Productivity per workstation per day** is the `r Pw` units of partially assemblied watch made by a worker within a day.
- **Cycle time** is the time cosuming to produce a unit watch which is `r paste(floor(7/300 * 60), 'minute', (((7/300) * 60) - (floor(7/300 * 60))) * 60, 'seconds')`.

## Part 2

  What is the total labor cost of assembly per watch when everything works as planned (no errors and breakdowns) completing the expected daily quantity?

- `r paste0('$', round(Pu, 2))` is the labor cost for assembly one watch.

## Part 3

  If the utilization for the line drops to 90% due to unplanned occurrences, how much extra time would be needed to complete the routine daily quantity of watches? Referring to Part 5 may help you address this question.

- If the production reduce to 90%, then `r 0.9 * 300` completed unit of watches will be produced per day. Therefore additional productivity hour of `r paste(floor((7/0.9 - 7) * 60), 'minutes', round((((7/0.9 - 7) * 60) - floor((7/0.9 - 7) * 60)) * 60, 2), 'seconds')` required in order to completed 300 units per day.
- The labor cost per unit will be increased `r paste0(round(((((5 * 7 * 15) / 270) / Pu - 1) * 100), 2), '%')` to `r paste0('$', round((5 * 7 * 15) / 270, 2))` since the productivity decreased 10% to 90%.
- The **productivity per hour per cycle** decreased to be `r floor(270/ 7)` units of completed unit watches and `r paste0(round((270/ 7) - floor(270/ 7), 2) * 100, '%')` of a partially assemblied unit of watch will be made per hour.

## Part 4

  The workers are paid a 50% premium for overtime work for up to 2 extra hours per day and which can be quantified in fractions of hours. What would be the total labor cost per unit based on completion of 300 units and including the overtime costs?

$$Overtime Paid / hour = 1.5 \times Wager$$
$$Wager / worker / day = 7 hours \times wager + overtime \times overtime wager$$

- additional 50% of paid for overtime which is `r paste0('$', round(15 * 1.5, 2))` per hour. Therefore additional paid for 5 workers for `r paste(floor((7/0.9 - 7) * 60), 'minutes', round((((7/0.9 - 7) * 60) - floor((7/0.9 - 7) * 60)) * 60, 2), 'seconds')` will be `r paste0('$', round(15 * 1.5, 2) * 5 * (7/0.9 - 7))` per day.
- Since 7 hours only able to produce 270 units. The total paid for 5 workers per day will be `r paste0('$', round(15 * 1.5 * 5 * (7/0.9 - 7), 2) + Pyp)` compre to initial `r paste0('$', Pyp)` to completed 300 units within a day.
- The labor cost per unit is **`r paste0('$', round((15 * 1.5 * 5 * (7/0.9 - 7) + Pyp) / 300, 2))`** and `r paste0(round(((15 * 1.5 * 5 * (7/0.9 - 7) + Pyp) / 300) / Pu, 2) * 100, '%')` of initial **`r paste0('$', Pu)`**.

## Part 5

  Please list at least one critical assumption that is necessary in computing the additional time and cost.

$$Max Wager / worker / day = 7 hours \times wager + 2 hours \times overtime wager$$

- Let's assume that the 300 units completed within 9 hours per day. Therefore the productivity time is now 7 hours normal working hours plus 2 hours overtime. ovetime paid `r paste0('$', 15 * 1.5 * 2)` + `r paste0('$', Pyw)` = `r paste0('$', (15 * 1.5 * 2) + Pyw)` for one worker. The total pay will be `r paste0('$', 5 * ((15 * 1.5 * 2) + Pyw))` per day.
- The labor cost per unit will be **`r paste0('$', (5 * ((15 * 1.5 * 2) + Pyw)) / 300)`** since 9 hours productivity hours needed to complete assembly 300 units compare to before `r paste('7 hours', floor((7/0.9 - 7) * 60), 'minutes', round((((7/0.9 - 7) * 60) - floor((7/0.9 - 7) * 60)) * 60, 2), 'seconds')`.

# 3. Conclusion

  I tried to write my answer above based on my understanding on the assignment prior to watch below video. I do say sorry since my Enlish language is not good. 
  
  From the observation above, we can conclude that lower productivity efficiency will increase the labor cost.

  Below is the answer from my peer while I am not unserstand why `The overtime =  (42/60)hrs = 0.7hrs`?

```
Process metrics/cost implication

Part 1

A line for final assembly of watches has 5 workstations with equal amount of work for the single worker at each station. The workers sit next to each other passing each watch to the worker at the next station as they are done. The workers are paid $15 per hour for the normal 7 hours of work per day. The line normally completes 300 watches per day.

When everything works as planned (no errors and breakdowns) completing the expected daily quantity, what is the implied cycle time at each workstation?
Solution:

All things being equal, the implied cycle time is thus calculated:-

CT=1/R

Where CT = Cycle or process time    ||   R= Flow rate

Then R= 300/(7*60)

Therefor CT= 7*60/300 = 1.4 Min.


Part 2

What is the total labor cost of assembly per watch when everything works as planned (no errors and breakdowns) completing the expected daily quantity?
Solution:

Pay for one (1) worker per day = 15*7 = $105

Total pay for five (5) workers per day = 105 * 5=$525

Total labor cost of assembly per watch= 525/300 = $1.75


Part 3

If the utilization for the line drops to 90% due to unplanned occurrences, how much extra time would be needed to complete the routine daily quantity of watches? Referring to Part 5 may help you address this question.

Solution:

300 watches per day (7hrs) at 100% utilization.

At 90 % utilization, we have 90/100 * 300 = 270 watches

Time to produce 30 (300-270) watches = 30/300 * 420 = 0.1 * 420 = 42 Min    or   0.7hrs


Part 4

The workers are paid a 50% premium for overtime work for up to 2 extra hours per day and which can be quantified in fractions of hours. What would be the total labor cost per unit based on completion of 300 units and including the overtime costs?
Solution:

The overtime =  (42/60)hrs = 0.7hrs

Overtime pay for one (1) worker at 100% utilization

 = (0.7 *15) + (0.7 *15 * 50/100) = 10.5 + 5.25 = $15.75

Total overtime paid to 5 workers = 15.75 * 5 = $78.75

Therefore, be the total labor cost per unit based on completion of 300 units and including the overtime costs 

= (525 + 78.75)/300 = 603.75 /300 = $2.0125

Is the correct answer given?


Part 5

Please list at least one critical assumption that is necessary in computing the additional time and cost.
100% utilization during overtime all things being equal.
