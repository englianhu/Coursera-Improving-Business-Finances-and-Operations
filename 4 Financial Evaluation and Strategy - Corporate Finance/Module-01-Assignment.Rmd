  The purpose of this assignment is to give you the opportunity to apply the concepts you have learned in this module and to discuss some of the key ideas of the module in your own words. Follow the instructions provided and respond to each question. This a required activity for this module. The activity is peer reviewed, so after you submit your responses, you will review submissions by fellow learners in the course.

## 1.2 Review criteria

  For *Assignment #1*, you will be responsible for evaluating the submissions of THREE of your peers. Before evaluating, please see the video I prepared with my discussion of the answers to *Assignment #1*.

  *Assignment #1* is worth 100 points total. Points are only given for correct/reasonable answers in the manner specified below, incorrect/unreasonable answers get zero points. Points should be allocated as follows:

**Question 1**

  - 10 points for a reasonable answer that is based on the arguments that we discussed in the lectures
  - 5 points for an incomplete answer or a correct answer that is too long (longer than 1 paragraph)

**Question 2**

  - 10 points for correctly identifying the package that is most likely to lead to shareholder value maximization and a reasonable explanation based on the arguments we discussed in the lectures
  - 5 points for choosing the wrong compensation package but justifying the choice with a reasonable argument, or for a correct answer that is too long (longer than 1 paragraph)
  - 2 points for correctly identifying the package but including no explanation

**Question 3**

  - 10 points for the correct liquidity ratios for all years and both companies
  - 5 points for an answer that is partially correct, for example not calculating the ratios for all years, or making a mistake on one of the ratios.

**Question 4**

  - 10 points for the correct leverage ratios for both companies
  - 5 points for an answer that is partially correct, for example not calculating all the leverage ratios, or making a mistake on one of the ratios.

**Question 5**

**Question 9**

  - 20 points for a well justified comparison of both companies that is based on the results of questions 3 to 8
  - 10 points for a reasonable but incomplete answer, for example not discussing one of the aspects such as valuation or profitability.

**Recommendations for Fair Peer Review:**

  - For questions that require calculations only, the score should be based on whether or not the answer provided is correct.
  - For subjective questions, the score should not be based on whether or not you agree with the answer, rather on whether the answer is complete and well-supported.
  - Both content and organization are important components of a response. Good writing is confident and clearly focused with relevant details to enrich the content. Good writing also follows instructions, such as word limits, and offers requested information.
  - A clear and concise answer is preferable to a long response that lacks coherence. Focus should be on content; try not to unduly penalize responses for spelling or grammar.

  - Section 2.9 [2.9 Question 9]

## 2.1 Question 1

```
  Explain why maximizing current stockholder wealth is a reasonable objective for the corporation (1 paragraph maximum).
```

 - Stockholder/shareholder invest the money on a corperate and expect the management growth the corperate to generate profit.
 - Due to the income of the corperate is generated by staffs since shareholder cannot spend thier time to oversee the operation of a corperate, therefore they hire/appoint a team of management to lead or manage the corperate.
 - Shareholders hold the right to sake the management team anytime if the management unable hit the target or vision expected by shareholders.
 - A corperate especially a public listed company need to acquire/inject fund from the stock market, the shareholders expected the company can growth and willing to invest. The performance of the management will be evaluate by the shareholders as well. Management level can be dictator only who hold a majority portion of shares and contribute a lot to the corperate. For example, Steve Jobs, Larry Ellison, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg are the soul of their own corperate.

## 2.2 Question 2

```
  A company’s board of directors must choose between two alternative compensation packages for top executives. Package 1 includes a fixed salary and an yearly bonus that depends on profits on that year. For example, the CEO gets paid a bonus if profits are higher than a certain target. Package 2 includes a fixed salary, and a certain amount of stock in the company. Which package is likely to be better from the point of view of shareholder value maximization? (1 paragraph maximum).
```

  - **Package 1**: Normally high salary paid to board of directors can stimulate them to growth the business group since high revnecue and also profit made by the group, the board of directors will also get higher paid.
  - However, there has pro and con since fixed salary will induce low quality and inefficiency of the board of directors becasue the salary might not affected by the revenue and also profit made by the group.
  - Normally a small and medium conservative busissness group do not take the high risk will offer the package 1. Some companies with a stable and certain business income might also offer package 1.
  
  - **Package 2**: A large and also some aggresive busissness group normally will offer a certain amount of stock of the company to the board of directors. The board of director will be stimulated and more loyal to growth the business group.
  - However the stress given by shareholders to the board of directors will also be high accordingly. The risk of saking is also high since the shareholders provide the rumination pay and expect the board of directors to join the big family, stand with shareholders (same objective and profit sharing from the stocks awarded by shareholders) and struggle and sincerely to growth the business group.

  - **Comparison**: package 1 might efficient within short-term period (might be 3 to 5 years or 8 to 10 years) due to high paid, however package 2 might probably get loyalty of board of directors who will stay and growth with the business group long life (might probably 30 to 50 years).
  - For example, not only Ladbrokes, William Hill prefer package 2... Maxbet, SBOBet and Crown offer package 2 to the management level and most of them work more than 10 to 20 years compare to William Hill and Ladbrokes.

## 2.3 Question 3

```
  Questions 3-9 will ask you to compute, compare, and analyze financial ratios for Nike Inc and V.F. Corporation. The data you need are in the linked spreadsheets.

  Here is some information about the companies from Capital IQ :

  NIKE, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, designs, develops, markets, and sells athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, and accessories for men, women, and kids worldwide. NIKE, Inc. was founded in 1964 and is headquartered in Beaverton, Oregon.

  V.F. Corporation was founded in 1899 and is headquartered in Greensboro, North Carolina. V.F. Corporation designs, manufactures, markets, and distributes branded lifestyle apparel, footwear, and accessories in the United States and Europe.

  Compute the main liquidity ratios for both Nike and V.F.Corporation (current ratios, quick ratios, and cash ratios). Do this for the last 3 years available. For Nike they will be May 2015, May 2014 and May 2013. For V.F.Corporation they will be July 2015 (latest-twelve months), January 2015, and December 2013.

*table 2.3.2: Current ratio of stock VFC.*

**What is the 'Current Ratio'?**

  The current ratio is a liquidity ratio that measures a company's ability to pay short-term and long-term obligations. To gauge this ability, the current ratio considers the current total assets of a company (both liquid and illiquid) relative to that company’s current total liabilities.

  The formula for calculating a company’s current ratio, then, is:

$$Current\ Ratio = Current\ Assets / Current\ Liabilities$$

  The current ratio is called “current” because, unlike some other liquidity ratios, it incorporates all current assets and liabilities.

  You can refer to [What is the 'Current Ratio'](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentratio.asp) for further details.

**What is the 'Quick Ratio'?**

  The quick ratio is an indicator of a company’s short-term liquidity. The quick ratio measures a company’s ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets. For this reason, the ratio excludes inventories from current assets, and is calculated as follows:

$Quick\ ratio = (current\ assets – inventories) / current\ liabilities$, or $Quick\ ratio = (cash\ and\ equivalents + marketable\ securities + accounts receivable) / current\ liabilities$

  The quick ratio measures the dollar amount of liquid assets available for each dollar of current liabilities. Thus, a quick ratio of 1.5 means that a company has \$1.50 of liquid assets available to cover each \$1 of current liabilities. The higher the quick ratio, the better the company's liquidity position. Also known as the “acid-test ratio" or "quick assets ratio."

**Liquidity Measurement Ratios: Cash Ratio**

  The cash ratio is an indicator of a company's liquidity that further refines both the current ratio and the quick ratio by measuring the amount of cash, cash equivalents or invested funds there are in current assets to cover current liabilities...
  
  Very few companies will have enough cash and cash equivalents to fully cover current liabilities, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, so don't focus on this ratio being above 1:1...

**Comparison**

  When we compare the liquidity of both companies from *table 2.3.1* and *table 2.3.2*:
  - *Current Ratio*: The current ratio of both companies are consider healthy since greater than 1. However we can know from the assets and liabilities and know that the assets and liabilities of NKE is increasing over the years but VFC reduced in assets but increase in liabilities. It might indicate VFC sold some assets to settle the debts and the company size is shrinking.
  - *Quick Ratio*: The quick ratio of NKE is greater than 1 but VFC faced liquidity problem in year 2015.
  - *Cash Ratio*: The cash ratio of NKE is around 1 indicates it is a healthy company but VFC has insufficient cash to cover liabilities but that is consider a normal phenomena.

## 2.4 Question 4

```
  Compute the main balance sheet leverage ratios for both Nike and V.F.Corporation (Debt/(Debt + Equity), and Liabilities/Assets). You only need to do this using the most recently available data so as to reflect the current valuation of the companies.

**Understanding Leverage Ratio**

  While some businesses pride themselves on being debt-free, most companies have had to borrow at one point or another to buy equipment, build new offices or cut payroll checks. For the investor, the challenge is determining whether the organization’s debt level is sustainable.

  Is having debt, in and of itself, harmful? Well, yes and no. In some cases, borrowing may actually be a positive sign. Consider a company that wants to build a new plant because of increased demand for its products. It may have to take out a loan or sell bonds to pay for the construction and equipment costs, but it’s expecting future sales to more than make up for any associated borrowing costs. And because interest expenses are tax-deductible, debt can be a cheaper way to increase assets than equity.

  The problem is when the use of debt, also known as leveraging, becomes excessive. With interest payments taking a large chunk out of top-line sales, a company will have less cash to fund marketing, research and development and other important investments.

  Large debt loads can make businesses particularly vulnerable during an economic downturn. If the corporation struggles to make regular interest payments, investors are likely to lose confidence and bid down the share price. In more extreme cases, bankruptcy becomes a very real possibility.

  For these reasons, seasoned investors take a good look at liabilities before purchasing corporate stock or bonds. As a way to quickly size up businesses in this regard, traders have developed a number of ratios that help separate healthy borrowers from those swimming in debt.

**Debt and Debt-to-Equity Ratios**

  Two of the most popular calculations, the debt ratio and debt-to-equity ratio, rely on information readily available on the company’s balance sheet. To determine the debt ratio, simply divide the firm’s total liabilities by its total assets:

$$Debt\ Ratio = Total\ Liabilities / Total\ Assets \cdots equation\ 2.4.4$$

  A figure of 0.5 or less is ideal. In other words, no more than half of the company’s assets should be financed by debt. In reality, many investors tolerate significantly higher ratios. Capital-intensive industries like heavy manufacturing depend more on debt than service-based firms, for example, and debt ratios in excess of 0.7 are common.

  As its name implies, the debt-to-equity ratio instead compares the company’s debt to its stockholder equity. It's calculated as follows:

$$Debt-to-equity\ Ratio = Total\ Liabilities / Stockholders'\ Equity \cdots equation\ 2.4.5$$

  If you consider the basic accounting equation (Assets – Liabilities = Equity), you may realize that these two equations are really looking at the same thing. In other words, a debt ratio of 0.5 will necessarily mean a debt-to-equity ratio of 1. In both cases, a lower number indicates a company less dependent on borrowing for its operations.

  While both these ratios can be useful tools, they're not without shortcomings. For example, both calculations include short-term liabilities in the numerator. Most investors, however, are more interested in long-term debt. For this reason, some traders will substitute “total liabilities” with “long-term liabilities” when crunching the numbers.

  In addition, some liabilities may not even appear on the balance sheet, and thus don’t enter into the ratio. Operating leases, commonly used by retailers, are one example. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP, doesn’t require companies to report these on the balance sheet, but they do show up in the footnotes. Investors who want a more accurate look at debt will want to comb through financial statements for this valuable information.

**Interest Coverage Ratio**

  Perhaps the biggest limitation of the debt and debt-to-equity ratios is that they look at the total amount of borrowing, not the company's ability to actually service its debt. Some organizations may carry what looks like a significant amount of debt, but they generate enough cash to easily handle interest payments.

  Furthermore, not all corporations borrow at the same rate. A company that has never defaulted on its obligations may be able to borrow at a 3 percent interest rate, while its competitor pays a 6 percent rate.

  To account for these factors, investors often use the interest coverage ratio. Rather than looking at the sum total of debt, the calculation factors in the actual cost of interest payments in relation to operating income (considered one of the best indicators of long-term profit potential). It's determined with this straightforward formula:

$$Interest\ Coverage\ Ratio = Operating\ Income / Interest\ Expense \cdots equation\ 2.4.6$$

  In this case, higher numbers are seen as favorable. In general, a ratio of 3 and above represents a strong ability to pay off debt, although here, too, the threshold varies from one industry to another.

**Comparison**

  When we observe from the *table 2.4.1B* and *table 2.4.2B*, we can know the company NKE is growing since assets, liabilities, equity all increase beyond the years but VFC almost fluctuate within a range.

**What is 'Cash Flow From Operating Activities (CFO)'?**

  Cash flow from operating activities (CFO) is an accounting item indicating the money a company brings in from ongoing, regular business activities, such as manufacturing and selling goods or providing a service. Cash flow from operating activities does not include long-term capital or investment costs. It does include earnings before interest and taxes plus depreciation minus taxes.

  Also called operating cash flow or net cash from operating activities, it can be calculated as follows:

$$Cash\ Flow\ From\ Operating\ Activities = EBIT + Depreciation - Taxes \cdots equation\ 2.7.1$$

**What is 'Cash Flow From Investing Activities'?**

  Cash flow from investing activities is an item on the cash flow statement that reports the aggregate change in a company's cash position resulting from any gains (or losses) from investments in the financial markets and operating subsidiaries and changes resulting from amounts spent on investments in capital assets such as plant and equipment.

  When analyzing a company's cash flow statement, it is important to consider each of the various sections which contribute to the overall change in cash position. In many cases, a firm may have negative overall cash flow for a given quarter, but if the company can generate positive cash flow from business operations, the negative overall cash.

**What is 'Cash Flow From Financing Activities'?**

  A category in a company’s cash flow statement that accounts for external activities that allow a firm to raise capital and repay investors, such as issuing cash dividends, adding or changing loans or issuing more stock. Cash flow from financing activities shows investors the company’s financial strength. A company that frequently turns to new debt or equity for cash, for example, could have problems if the capital markets become less liquid.

  The formula for cash flow from financing activities is as follows:

$$Cash\ Received\ from\ Issuing\ Stock\ or\ Debt - Cash\ Paid\ as\ Dividends\ and Re-Acquisition\ of\ Debt/Stock \cdots equation\ 2.7.2$$

Read more: [Cash Flow from Financing Activities Definition | Investopedia](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashflowfromfinancing.asp#ixzz4EVLShE5Y)

**Comparison**

  From above tables, we observed that both companies make profit from the cash flow, while NKE had refinanced and repurchased the stock in year 2014.
  
  - *Cash from operating activities*: positive figure means both companies making money from the business.
  - *Cash from investing activities*: The negative figure might indicate the company buying assets or repurchased the stock. You can refer to *table 2.5.1A* and *table 2.5.1B* to know the assets and equity as well. Examples of negative cash flow from investing activities includes the purchase of fixed assets, the purchase of investment instruments such as stocks, and lending money. Examples of positive cash flow from investing includes the sale of fixed assets, the sale of investment instruments, and the collection of loans and insurance proceeds.
  - *Cash from financing activities*: Financing activities that generate negative cash flow include spending cash to repurchase previously issued stock, to pay down debt, to pay interest on debt and to pay dividends to shareholders.


## 2.8 Question 8

```
  Compute the main valuation ratios for Nike and V.F.Corporation (Value/OPAT and Market/Book). You only need to do this using the most recently available data so as to reflect the current valuation of the companies.
```
![*figure 2.8.1: Valuation ratio.*](figure/market-book.jpg)

**Market Value Versus Book Value**

  Understanding the difference between book value and market value is a simple yet fundamentally critical component of any attempt to analyze a company for investment. After all, when you invest in a share of stock or an entire business, you want to know you are paying a sensible price.

  Book value literally means the value of the business according to its "books" or financial statements. In this case, book value is calculated from the balance sheet, and it is the difference between a company's total assets and total liabilities. Note that this is also the term for shareholders' equity. For example, if Company XYZ has total assets of \$100 million and total liabilities of \$80 million, the book value of the company is \$20 million. In a very broad sense, this means that if the company sold off its assets and paid down its liabilities, the equity value or net worth of the business, would be $20 million.

  Market value is the value of a company according to the stock market. Market value is calculated by multiplying a company's shares outstanding by its current market price. If Company XYZ has 1 million shares outstanding and each share trades for \$50, then the company's market value is $50 million. Market value is most often the number analysts, newspapers and investors refer to when they mention the value of the business.

**Implications of Each**

  Book value simply implies the value of the company on its books, often referred to as accounting value. It's the accounting value once assets and liabilities have been accounted for by a company's auditors. Whether book value is an accurate assessment of a company's value is determined by stock market investors who buy and sell the stock. Market value has a more meaningful implication in the sense that it is the price you have to pay to own a part of the business regardless of what book value is stated.

  As you can see from our fictitious example from Company XYZ above, market value and book value differ substantially. In the actual financial markets, you will find that book value and market value differ the vast majority of the time. The difference between market value and book value can depend on various factors such as the company's industry, the nature of a company's assets and liabilities, and the company's specific attributes. There are three basic generalizations about the relationships between book value and market value:

  - **Book Value Greater Than Market Value**: The financial market values the company for less than its stated value or net worth. When this is the case, it's usually because the market has lost confidence in the ability of the company's assets to generate future profits and cash flows. In other words, the market doesn't believe that the company is worth the value on its books. Value investors often like to seek out companies in this category in hopes that the market perception turns out to be incorrect. After all, the market is giving you the opportunity to buy a business for less than its stated net worth.
  - **Market Value Greater Than Book Value**: The market assigns a higher value to the company due to the earnings power of the company's assets. Nearly all consistently profitable companies will have market values greater than book values.
  - **Book Value Equals Market Value**: The market sees no compelling reason to believe the company's assets are better or worse than what is stated on the balance sheet.

  It's important to note that on any given day, a company's market value will fluctuate in relation to book value. The metric that tells this is known as the price-to-book ratio, or the P/B ratio:

$$P/B\ Ratio = Share\ Price/Book\ Value\ Per\ Share \cdots equation\ 2.8.1$$

  (where Book Value Per Share equals shareholders' equity divided by number of shares outstanding)

  So one day, a company can have a P/B of 1, meaning that BV and MV are equal. The next day, the market price drops and the P/B ratio is less than 1, meaning market value is less than book value. The following day the market price zooms higher and creates a P/B ratio of greater than 1, meaning market value now exceeds book value. To an investor, whether the P/B ratio is 0.95, 1 or 1.1, the underlying stock trades at book value. In other words, P/B becomes more meaningful the greater the number differs from 1. To a value-seeking investor, a company that trades for a P/B ratio of 0.5 implies that the market value is one-half of the company's stated book value. In other words, the market is selling you each $1 of net assets (net assets = assets - liabilities) for 50 cents. Everyone likes to buy things on sale, right?

*table 2.8.1: Valuation ratio of company NKE and VFC.*

  - **Market Value ÷ Operating Profits After Taxes**: these ratio consider as the investors' prospective ratio in financial market based on every single dollar net profit. Normally a company make profit consistantly will has a ratio which more than 1. NKE has greater ratio than VFC since we can know NKE is healthier than VFC from the cash flow and other key ratios from income and balance statements.
  - **Market Value ÷ Book Value**: Both companies have a ratio which greater than 1, it means investors in financial market forecast these two companies will keeping make profit. Normally a company make profit consistantly will has a ratio which more than 1. NKE has greater ratio than VFC since we can know NKE is healthier than VFC from the cash flow and other key ratios from income and balance statements.

## 2.9 Question 9

```
  Discuss the implications of your results. How do the two companies compare to each other? What have you learned from the comparison of financial ratios for these two companies? (2 paragraphs maximum)
```
  As conclusion to compare with these two companies:
  
  - From *table 2.3.1* and *table 2.3.2*, we can know the current ratio, quick ratio and also cash ratio of NKE are greater than VFC's. The ratio greater than 1 means that the company can reaction quicky on any unforeseen financial turnover issue and indicate that the company is a healthy company with sufficient cash.
  - From *table 2.4.1B* and *table 2.4.2B*, we know the company size of NKE is larger than VFC. *table 2.4.3* shows both companies have low levarage ratio on debt.
  - *table 2.5.1A* and *table 2.5.1B* are the income statement of both comapny which showing the business revenue of NKE is greater than VFC. *table 2.5.2A* and *table 2.5.2B* are the tables differentiate the profitability ratio of both companies whic are alsmost similar but the Asset-turnover ratio of VFC slighly increase as year goes by.
  - Cash profitanility ratios from *table 2.6.1A* and *table 2.6.1B* are the cash flow rate from assets. NKE has greater ratio than VFC. Meanwhile, the CFOA of NKE in year 2015 increase from 2014 but oppsite with VFC.
  - The cash flow statement in *table 2.7.1A* and *table 2.7.1B* show both companies repurchase the stock of own company. Normally when a company think thier business growth is undervalued by the market value will buyback the stock. Sometimes that is due to the company protest from the speculations by hedge fund or hostile takeover by other business group.
  - *table 2.8.1* shows the market valuation ratio of both companies. The ratio indicates the investors prospective to the company. Investors from financial market evaluated NKE's from its past and current value and optimistic to its future prospect and growing rate will be better than future value of VFC.
