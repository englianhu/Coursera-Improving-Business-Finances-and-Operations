## 1.1 Overview

  The purpose of this assignment is to give you the opportunity to apply the concepts you have learned in this module and to discuss some of the key ideas of the module in your own words. Follow the instructions provided and respond to each question. This a required activity for this module. The activity is peer reviewed, so after you submit your responses, you will review submissions by fellow learners in the course.

## 1.2 Review criteria

  For *Assignment #1*, you will be responsible for evaluating the submissions of THREE of your peers. Before evaluating, please see the video I prepared with my discussion of the answers to *Assignment #1*.

  *Assignment #1* is worth 100 points total. Points are only given for correct/reasonable answers in the manner specified below, incorrect/unreasonable answers get zero points. Points should be allocated as follows:

**Question 1**

  - 10 points for a reasonable answer that is based on the arguments that we discussed in the lectures
  - 5 points for an incomplete answer or a correct answer that is too long (longer than 1 paragraph)

**Question 2**

  - 10 points for correctly identifying the package that is most likely to lead to shareholder value maximization and a reasonable explanation based on the arguments we discussed in the lectures
  - 5 points for choosing the wrong compensation package but justifying the choice with a reasonable argument, or for a correct answer that is too long (longer than 1 paragraph)
  - 2 points for correctly identifying the package but including no explanation

**Question 3**

  - 10 points for the correct liquidity ratios for all years and both companies
  - 5 points for an answer that is partially correct, for example not calculating the ratios for all years, or making a mistake on one of the ratios.

**Question 4**

  - 10 points for the correct leverage ratios for both companies
  - 5 points for an answer that is partially correct, for example not calculating all the leverage ratios, or making a mistake on one of the ratios.

**Question 5**

  - 10 points for the correct profitability ratios for all years and both companies
  - 5 points for an answer that is partially correct, for example not calculating the ratios for all years, or making a mistake on one of the ratios.

**Question 6**

  - 10 points for the correct cash profitability ratios for all years and both companies
  - 5 points for an answer that is partially correct, for example not calculating the ratios for all years, or making a mistake on one of the ratios.

**Question 7**

  - 10 points for the correct analysis of the cash flow statement for both companies
  - 5 points for an answer that is partially correct, for example making a mistake on the analysis of investment cash flows

**Question 8**

  - 10 points for the correct valuation ratios for both companies
  - 5 points for an answer that is partially correct, for example not calculating all the valuation ratios, or making a mistake on one of the ratios.

**Question 9**

  - 20 points for a well justified comparison of both companies that is based on the results of questions 3 to 8
  - 10 points for a reasonable but incomplete answer, for example not discussing one of the aspects such as valuation or profitability.

**Recommendations for Fair Peer Review:**

  - For questions that require calculations only, the score should be based on whether or not the answer provided is correct.
  - For subjective questions, the score should not be based on whether or not you agree with the answer, rather on whether the answer is complete and well-supported.
  - Both content and organization are important components of a response. Good writing is confident and clearly focused with relevant details to enrich the content. Good writing also follows instructions, such as word limits, and offers requested information.
  - A clear and concise answer is preferable to a long response that lacks coherence. Focus should be on content; try not to unduly penalize responses for spelling or grammar.

## 1.3 Instructions

  There are multiple steps to this assignment.

  First, you will submit your answers to each of the 9 questions based on the information in the Assignment Details section. Enter your answers directly in the spaces provided in the My submission tab. You may save a draft of your work as you go, and you can come back later to continue working on your draft. When you are finished working, click the Preview button, verify your identity, and then Submit the assignment. Please answer each question fully and concisely.

  Then, you will evaluate the submissions of at least THREE of your peers based on the instructions provided. You may begin giving feedback to other students as soon as you submit your assignment, click the Review peers tab to begin. Feel free to provide additional reviews beyond the three required!

  Assignment 1 is described in *Video Lesson 1-10*, you should watch this video before doing the assignment.

Package 2 includes a fixed salary, and a certain amount of stock in the company. Which package is likely to be better from the point of view of shareholder value maximization? (1 paragraph maximum).

For Nike they will be May 2015, May 2014 and May 2013. For V.F.Corporation they will be July 2015 (latest-twelve months), January 2015, and December 2013.

## 4.3 Speech and Blooper

  I do appreciate that [University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign](http://illinois.edu/) provides the [Improving Business Finances and Operations](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/business-operations) specialization via [Coursera](http://www.coursera.org). I used to study [Certified Accounting Technician (CAT)](http://www.accaglobal.com/ie/en/student/exam-support-resources/foundation-level-study-resources.html) course at [PAAC](http://www.paac.edu.my/index.php?p=location) more more decade. Now I need to review the finance and accounting course prior to conduct my research [Analyse the Finance and Stocks Price of Bookmakers](https://github.com/scibrokes/analyse-the-finance-and-stocks-price-of-bookmakers).
  There are few books that I need to read for further understanding.
