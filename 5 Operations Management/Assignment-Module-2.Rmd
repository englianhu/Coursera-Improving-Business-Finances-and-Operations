**Module 1 Assignment 2**

Following are the relevant figures extracted from the balance sheet and income statement of two companies, a consumer electronics manufacturer and a large retailer.

# 2. Operational Concepts

## 2.1 Compute the asset turnover for each company.


```{r ROE, echo = TRUE}
suppressMessages(library('dplyr'))

roe <- suppressWarnings(as.list(paste0(round(tbl1[2, ]/tbl1[4, ] * 100, 2), '%')))
roe %<>% data.frame %>% tbl_df
names(roe) <- names(tbl2)
roe %<>% mutate(Category = 'Return of Equity')
roe <- rbind(tbl2[c(2, 4), ], roe)

roe %>% kable(Caption = 'Table 2.3 : Comparison of Asset-Turnover of two companies')
```

*Table 2.1 : Comparison of Asset-Turnover of two companies.*

**What is 'Asset Turnover Ratio'?**

  Asset turnover ratio is the ratio of the value of a company’s sales or revenues generated relative to the value of its assets. The Asset Turnover ratio can often be used as an indicator of the efficiency with which a company is deploying its assets in generating revenue.

  $Asset Turnover = Sales or Revenues / Total Assets$

  Generally speaking, the higher the asset turnover ratio, the better the company is performing, since higher ratios imply that the company is generating more revenue per dollar of assets. Yet, this ratio can vary widely from one industry to the next. As such, considering the asset turnover ratios of an energy company and a telecommunications company will not make for an accurate comparison. Comparisons are only meaningful when they are made for different companies within the same sector.

## 2.2 Compute the operating margin for each company.

## 2.3 Compute the return on equity for each company.

```{r ROE, echo = TRUE}
suppressMessages(library('dplyr'))

roe <- suppressWarnings(as.list(paste0(round(tbl1[2, ]/tbl1[4, ] * 100, 2), '%')))
roe %<>% data.frame %>% tbl_df
names(roe) <- names(tbl2)
roe %<>% mutate(Category = 'Return of Equity')
roe <- rbind(tbl2[c(2, 4), ], roe)

roe %>% kable(Caption = 'Table 2.3 : Comparison of Return-On-Equity of two companies')
```

*Table 2.3 : Comparison of Return-On-Equity of two companies.*

**What is 'Return On Equity - ROE'?**

  Return on equity (ROE) is the amount of net income returned as a percentage of shareholders equity. Return on equity measures a corporation's profitability by revealing how much profit a company generates with the money shareholders have invested.

  ROE is expressed as a percentage and calculated as:

  $Return on Equity = Net Income/Shareholder's Equity$

  Net income is for the full fiscal year (before dividends paid to common stock holders but after dividends to preferred stock.) Shareholder's equity does not include preferred shares.

Also known as "return on net worth" (RONW).

## 2.4 What does your analysis suggest about the differences in operations performance of the two companies?



# 3. Conclusion

  Due to my am not a staff of **IKEA** and went there few years once. Here I only give some own opinion and recall the story of the **IKEA** about the business operatonal concept of **IKEA**. Kindly correct me if there has any wrong.

## 4.3 Speech and Blooper

  Firstly, I do appreciate that [University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign](http://illinois.edu/) provides the management course via [Coursera](http://www.coursera.org). I like reading the legend of business tycoons (for example: Konosuke Matsushita, Peter Drucker, Bill Gates, Warrent Buffet, George Soros, Jim Rogers, Lee Kah Sheng, Henry Fok Ying Tung, Peter Lynch, Lim Goh Tong etc) to know how was their mindset and business strategy since I was a computer science student in Tunku Abdul Rahman College. I used to read the legend of **Ingvar Kamprad** and just recall it.
  
  [宜家为何"永远不会上市"?](http://www.xcf.cn/tt2/201506/t20150609_750676.htm) roughly eleborate the background of the **IKEA**. There has another business legend from China which has own electronical business emperor although backcrupcy and had been jailed since few years ago.
